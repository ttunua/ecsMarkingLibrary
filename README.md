# ecsMarkingLibrary

I have added methods to start moving towards automating marking for assignments that use our first year library.
The basic concept is that we can read the input class file and find question sites. These can be collected and ordered so
that we can provide mock inputs that match the object types later. Eventually, we should be able to automate marking for most 
combinations of inputs
